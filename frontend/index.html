                During my time at CFC, I have been exposed to more complex environments and technologies. Working more frequently with routers and networking equipment, both through GUIs and CLIs, has expanded my existing knowledge of networking and computing as a whole and introduced me to different ways of working and interacting with systems. A large focus of the business is on Disaster Recovery, securing clients from potential loss of data incidents. This role has been my first exposure to in-depth enterprise-grade DR solutions, focusing my view on data security and protecting clients' infrastructure and core systems. It has built on my knowledge of cybersecurity procedures and methods used to better protect clients. I often visit clients' workplaces, including commercial offices and sometimes homes, to install new hardware or troubleshoot issues that cannot be resolved remotely. Managing my own schedule has given me much more freedom to operate how I see fit, uphold customer relations, and get hands-on with hardware and various equipment. Working within a small team has pushed me to take on a lot of responsibility and workload, bettering my ability to manage and prioritize important tasks while maintaining high standards. Working completely remotely has pushed me to work harder, maintain focus on my workload, and improve my self-sufficiency and ability to stay focused and persevere during difficult tasks.

                <span class="job-title">IT Support Engineer, Mellow Marsh Software Ltd</span> <span class="job-period">(August 2019 – December 2021)</span><br>
                Working within an MSP environment involved taking calls throughout the day while also managing fast-paced ticket queues and incoming emails. Successfully liaising with companies from various professional backgrounds enabled me to work with different technologies and software, allowing me to adapt to different client needs, improve my skillset, and broaden my knowledge of the IT industry. Exposure to PBX Phone systems and Telephony technologies inspired me to dive into these kinds of problems head-on to develop less experienced aspects of my skillset.

                The remote nature of working on a service desk required the ability to troubleshoot and communicate effectively, as there were times when I could not visually see the issue. Communicating with individuals at various IT skill levels made excellent customer service an essential part of my skillset.
